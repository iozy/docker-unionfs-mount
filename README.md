# unionfs-mount

Create a unionfs mount, merging the content of a read only source, and a read/write source folder.

It is based on alpine linux and leverages s6-overlay's SIGTERM handling to achieve a clean unionfs unmount when the container is stopped.

No more 'Transport endpoint is not connected"! :)

## Docker CLI Usage 
```sh
docker run -d \
 --name=unionfs-mount \
 --privileged \
 --env TZ=Europe/Berlin \
 --env PUID=1026 \
 --env PGID=100 \
 --volume $PWD/archive:/read-only:ro\
 --volume $PWD/current:/read-write:rw\
 --volume $PWD/unionfs:/merged:shared \
  iozy/unionfs-mount:latest
```

## Docker Compose Usage 
```
version: '2.2'
services:
  unionfs:
    image: iozy/unionfs-mount:latest
    container_name: unionfs-mount
    privileged: true
    volumes:
    - $PWD/archive:/read-only:ro
    - $PWD/current:read-write:rw
    - $PWD/unionfs:/merged:shared
    environment:
      TZ: 'Europe/Berlin'
      PUID: '1026'
      PGID: '100'
    network_mode: 'none'
```

## Parameters
The environment parameters are split into two halves, separated by an equal, the left hand side representing the variable name the right its value.

| ENV| DEFAULT | DESCRIPTION |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| TZ | Europe/Berlin | The timezone to use for file operations and the log. |
| PUID | 1000 | The user id used to access files. |
| PGID | 1000 | The group id used to access files. |
| MOUNT_PATH  | /merged |  Optional: the container target path for the unionfs volume mapping. |

The volume parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side.

| VOLUMES |  DESCRIPTION |
| ------ | ------ |
| /read-only  |  The read only mount point. |
| /read-write |  The read write mount point.|
| /merged  |  The unionfs mount. Needs to match the MOUNT_PATH. |

The examples form above assume that `/read-only` and `/read-writ`e exist localy in your filesystem.

If the host path for the `/read-only` bind is a mounted remote share, you might want to switch the propagation from `ro` to `shared`.

If the host path for the `/read-write` bind is a mounted remote share, you might want to switch the propagation from `rw` to `shared`.

See for further details: https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation

## Shell access
For shell access while the container is running, `docker exec -it unionfs-mount /bin/sh`

## Troubleshooting
The filesystem where the host path is located needs to be marked as shared. Otherwise the volume binding for /unionfs will result in an error and the container will not start. To mark a filesystem as shared, adopt following line to your needs:
```sh
mount --make-shared /
```
Please use the mount point of your volume, as the mount point "/" is just an example.

If you expose your unionfs folder as a remote share: 
- nfs: unionfs folder is empty
- cifs: unionfs folder can see and access the content

## Docker Swarm
Since the container needs to be run in privliged mode, this image can not be used on Docker Swarm. Sadly, Docker Swarm lacks support for priviliged containers.
